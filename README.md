**Cryptography Cipher**

This Python script demonstrates the a historical cryptography cipher called the Caesar Cipher. A simple encryption technique that shifts each letter in a message by a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. The same shift value is used for both encryption and decryption.

**Features**

Modify the message and key variables to use your own message and desired shift value. Feel free to experiment with different messages and keys to explore the Caesar cipher!
